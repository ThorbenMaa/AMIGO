`popt` contains folders `7`, `7-5`, `8`, `8-5`, `9`, `9-5`, and `10` are folders where the protein's data set was run with differenet cut-off ranges for parameter optimization.
The according ratios and plots can be found in `./../analysis_final.ods`.

`p=1` contains the full runs for the three best cut-off ranges, the script `compare.py` (used to extract shared assignments between the three runs), and the file `topThree_assignment.tsv` (contains the final assignments shared in AMIGO runs with the three optimal cut-off ranges).

The final performance using the best cut-off distance range and the three best cut-off ranges can be found in `./../analysis_final.ods`.
