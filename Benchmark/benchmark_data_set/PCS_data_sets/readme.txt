This folder contains AMIGO results for data sets with PCSs. The summarised results can be found in `./../analysis_final.ods`.

Note that the AMIGO scripts used here only work for the given examples, as some of the input parameters are hard-encoded within the python script (for the examples, the code base is identical to AMIGO_non_interactive.py; just the way parameters are submitted to the script and the format of the result files is different). Cut off distance ranges can be submitted using the interactive user dialogue. The minimal cut-off distance was 3 for all labelled amino acids (see respective noe.txt files). The maximal one is indicated in the respective folder names. The step size was 0.2. For GTB and MNV P-domain, the additional weight factors were 100, 100, 100, and 0. For LmUGP the additional weight factors were 0, 100, 100, 0. The weight factor for NOEs was always set to 1. All these information is also given in the respective result.txt files.
